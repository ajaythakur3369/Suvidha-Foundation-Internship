## During the Internship, I worked on the following Project:  

  - **Text Summarization -** Implemented a **Model** for **Abstractive Text Summarization** using **GloVe** and **RNN Encoder-Decoder** models with a sample dataset of news articles (**CNN**, **Daily Mail**) with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **NLTK**, **Pickle**, and others.
