''\\n\\nThe then-26-year-old victim in that attack was able to provide enough of a detailed description to yield a police sketch , one that years later would link Matthew to the case of Morgan Harrington , the Virginia Tech student who vanished in Charlottesville in October 2009 .\\n\\nHarrington was found dead the following January . Police at the time said `` forensic evidence '' linked the two cases .\\n\\nFairfax County prosecutor Ray Morrogh said Monday that he could not comment on how this investigation and indictment relates to the Harrington or Graham cases , but said `` the facts and details will be revealed in the judicial process . ''\\n\\nJim Camblos , Matthew 's Charlottesville attorney in the Graham case , declined to comment when reached by CNN on Monday .\\n\\nGraham last seen September 13\\n\\nGraham , a University of Virginia student , was last spotted on several surveillance cameras in Charlottesville 's Downtown Mall area on September 13 . The footage showed her leaving the Tempo Bar around 2 a.m. , followed by a man investigators think to be Matthew .\\n\\nMore than a month later , on October 18 , Sgt. Dale Terry of the Chesterfield Sheriff 's Department and his small search team were finishing up for the day when behind an abandoned home -- just eight miles from where Hannah Graham was last seen -- they found a skull and bones scattered across a creek bed .\\n\\n`` It was not buried , and its location was not far from the road , '' he told a local television station . `` There was not any crushing of any bones . As far as the skull , everything looked to be intact to me . ''\\n\\nNearby was a pair of black pants , similar to ones Graham was wearing when she was last seen .\\n\\n`` I do believe God wanted us to find what we found , '' Terry said . `` I do n't know how else to explain it other than something inside me told me to just continue to look . ''\\n\\nAfter Saturday 's discovery , the weekend 's remaining public searches were canceled so that authorities could focus their attention `` on recent evidence , '' according to the Virginia Department of Emergency Management .\\n\\nFurthermore , police now consider the Graham case `` a death investigation , '' said County Police Chief Steve Sellers .\\n\\n`` Today 's discovery is a significant development , and we have a great deal of work ahead of us , '' Sellers said . `` We can not and we will not jump to any conclusions . ''\\n\\nForensic psychologist Mike Banks told CNN affiliate WTVR that forensic work could take some time .\\n\\n`` If it is Hannah Graham , 100 % , then at least they have their child home , '' he said , referring to Graham 's parents , John and Susan Graham .\\n\\nThe Albemarle County Police Department said it did n't know how long it will take for the forensic results to come back .\\n\\n\",\n",

            "I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.\n",
